         <p>This is my baby, a place where open conversation about all topics is welcomed and needed. my goal for this place is to have open dialog from people with every kind of opinion, especially the ones that are directly opposing mine. Also this is a place for me to on occasion spew my frustrations and angers at the way our world acts at any given time. So please join me here for what I hope to be an awesome place of fun and debate. </p>
